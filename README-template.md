## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was a great challenge to my javascript skills. As i'm continously learning about web development i came across new concepts that i have never worked with before. My main learning was state management in javascript. This is something that i would need to practice more to master.

### Continued development

This challenge opened my eyes on OOP and state management. It is essential for me to understand those concepts before moving on to libraries and frameworks that are based on javascript.
